      <h1>Cultural Appropriation</h1>

      <p>
        Cultural appropriation is the term used to describe the usage of items
        or aspects from a non-dominant culture in a way that supports oppression
        or perpetuates stereotypes while also disregarding its creator. It also
        involves the unlicensed use of aspects of their culture, such as their
        dress and dancing. When someone from one culture adopts clothing,
        iconography, trends, or styles from another culture that is not their
        own, this is known as cultural appropriation, sometimes known as
        cultural misappropriation. When a historically oppressed group's culture
        is being appropriated, some of the practice's most damaging instances
        occur.

        <h2>Elements of Cultural Appropriation</h2>

        <b>Culture </b>
        <p>
          Anything connected to a group of people based on their ethnicity,
          religion, geography, or social environment is referred to as their
          culture. The term "culture" refers to the beliefs, customs, language,
          artifacts, behaviors, conventions, values, or institutions of a
          particular ethnic group.
        </p>
        <b>Appropriation</b>
        <p>
          Appropriation refers to taking something that doesnâ€™t belong to you or
          your culture. When something is appropriated, the historical context
          that informs it is not understood or appreciated.
        </p>
        <b>Cultural Designation</b>
        <p>
          When someone adopts a characteristic from another culture with the
          intent of demeaning or demeaning members of that society, this is
          known as cultural denigration.
        </p>
        <b>Cultural Apppreciation & Respect</b>
        <p>
          Cultural appreciation entails the respectful adoption of components
          from another culture to exchange ideas and broaden one's perspective.
          Cultural appreciation can lead to tremendous respect and understanding
          between civilizations and innovative hybrids that combine different
          cultures.

        <b>How to avoid Cultural Appropriation?</b>
        <p>Before you "borrow" from a culture, remember these questions:</p>
        <li>Am I using something sacred to another culture?</li>
        <li>Do my actions support stereotypes?</li>
        <li>Am I neglecting to credit the source of my inspiration?</li>
        <p>
          You will probably be able to prevent cultural appropriation if you can
          confidently respond "no" to each of those questions.
