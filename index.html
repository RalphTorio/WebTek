      <h1>Cultural Appropriation</h1>

      <p>
        Cultural appropriation is the term used to describe the usage of items
        or aspects from a non-dominant culture in a way that supports oppression
        or perpetuates stereotypes while also disregarding its creator. It also
        involves the unlicensed use of aspects of their culture, such as their
        dress and dancing. When someone from one culture adopts clothing,
        iconography, trends, or styles from another culture that is not their
        own, this is known as cultural appropriation, sometimes known as
        cultural misappropriation. When a historically oppressed group's culture
        is being appropriated, some of the practice's most damaging instances
        occur.
