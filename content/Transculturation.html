      <p>
        A process of cultural transformation known as transculturation is
        characterized by the entrance of new cultural components and the loss or
        modification of preexisting ones. Essentially, it is a type of
        socialization and, thus, is a continual process of cultural learning and
        relearning. Transculturation comprises the interactions between cultures
        through which a person continuously broadens their knowledge of and
        aptitude for various cultures. It is challenging to identify and credit
        the source when using this form because it takes components from several
        civilizations and combines them.
