        A process of cultural transformation known as transculturation is
        characterized by the entrance of new cultural components and the loss or
        modification of preexisting ones. Essentially, it is a type of
        socialization and, thus, is a continual process of cultural learning and
        relearning. Transculturation comprises the interactions between cultures
        through which a person continuously broadens their knowledge of and
        aptitude for various cultures. It is challenging to identify and credit
        the source when using this form because it takes components from several
        civilizations and combines them.

      <img id="trc_sampleA" src="/../image/Trc_SampleA.png" alt="Migratory Flows" class="trcA"/>
      <p>
        -The arrival of migratory movements from one location to another frequently 
        modifies cultural patterns from one place. Many nations, particularly Latin 
        America, attribute their current traits to the tribes that settled there. In 
        this way, it's possible that a population, an even more significant one that 
        currently resides in a nation with specific rules, would arrive, and some of 
        the rules of a foreign cultural group would be absorbed. For instance, 
        almost every city has a Chinatown

      <p>
        -Through successful economic and cultural interactions, a new cultural form is 
        introduced. It frequently happens because the individuals who adopt the new forms 
        believe the new patterns are superior, but it can also occur solely due to market 
        forces. For instance, the spread of new technology changed the music that is listened 
        to in most western countries, allowing for the simultaneous listening of dozens of 
        musicians in various locations.
