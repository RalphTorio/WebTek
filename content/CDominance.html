      <p>
        Cultural dominance is the use of elements of a dominant culture by
        members of a subordinated culture in a context in which the dominant
        culture has been imposed onto the subordinated culture, including
        appropriations that enact resistance.
      </p>
      <p>
        Dominance of culture that is preserved over a specific period of time.
        This preservation of dominant culture may be influenced by social and
        governmental systems, where people with strong influence and authority
        significantly affect the belief, behavior, values, and standards of the
        society they govern or manage.
      </p>
      <b>Example: </b>
      <p> </p>
      <img id="dom_sample" src="/../image/Dom_Sample.png" alt="Male Guardianship System" class = "center" />
      <p>
        -In Saudi Arabia, a man is in charge of a woman's life from birth until 
        she passes away. Every woman must have a male guardian who has the authority 
        to make several important choices on her behalf. Typically, this guardian 
        is a father or husband, but in other situations, it may be a brother or son. 
        Women are essentially treated as perpetual legal adolescents by the Saudi 
        government. The Saudi Arabian government has made very little progress in 
        eradicating the system, which continues to be the most significant barrier to 
        women's rights in the nation.
